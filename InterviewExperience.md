Interview Experience || Shell India

Round 1: Shell was on campus for recruitment for the post of SDE. The eligible branches were CSE and IT only. The first round had 700 students shortlisted from both the branches included. The first round was an online test of one and a half hours. It consisted of 3 sections: aptitude and logical reasoning, technical and coding. In the technical section there were 30 MCQ’s. It covered the concepts on DBMS, OS, Software engineering, DSA and some questions in which we have to answer the output of the code snippet. Most of the questions were from DBMS and it is highly recommended to go through all the concepts and learn how to write queries. The coding section had 2 problems that were to be solved in 45 minutes. The difficulty level of the codes were moderate and can be solved easily if you have a grasp on coding concepts. The last section was aptitude and logical reasoning.

After a week, 40 students were shortlisted from 700 students for the next round and I was one among them.

Round 2: This round was F2F round which was conducted through Skype from the team in Bengaluru. There were a total of 8 panels and the average time for the interview was 1hr 15 minutes. My interview stretched to about one and a half hour.

Each panel had 2 people and at first technical questions were asked followed by a bunch of situation based questions. Prepare a good introductory speech for 2 mins on yourself. Try to say something which is not mentioned in your resume and on which you want some questions to be asked. After that, they asked me to explain the projects that I have done and then they asked questions on the project. Some questions on How and Why from the projects. Then, they asked me about my skills and the technologies I have worked on. They asked me about 10-15 questions on Java and OOPS concept and some DS questions on linked list, queue and stack. After that, they asked me about the project that I’ve done in my internship and asked me if there is a better approach. As I’ve mentioned Docker on my Resume, so there was a discussion about it along with some questions for about 15 minutes. They asked some questions on containers and how they differ from VMs. 

Then, after that they switched to behavioural interview in which I have to answer questions based on the situations that I’ve faced in my life. Some of the questions were:

Q1. Tell me about the time when you face some difficulty in your project and how you behaved.

Q2. Tell me about a situation where you mentored someone and how you handle it.

Q3. Tell me about the time, when you faced some conflicts in your team.

Q4. How is your behaviour in team projects? How do you handle the situation in which someone is not doing their part?

At last, they asked if I have any question, and I asked one related to the culture in the company. Always, have a question prepared for them, it creates a positive impact on the interviewer.

At the end of this round, 20 students were selected out of 40 for FTE and I was one of them.
Hope this helps.
